  Inner Sphere Map Data
  	The data for the maps used here come from the Pryde Rock Stellar Cartography datafiles
  	produced by Medron Pryde (http://www.pryderockindustries.com/dl_game_aids.php#ISM)
  	These files are in turn based on Mike Flynn's Inner Sphere Cartography Society data
  	at http://iscs.teamspam.net/
  	  
  And Of Course...
     FASA, WizKids, FanPro and Catalyst Game Labs for creating and publishing the original game of 
     BattleTech, a source of fun and inspiration to us all.
