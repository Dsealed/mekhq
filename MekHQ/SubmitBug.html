<h1>How to submit a MekHQ bug</h1>
<body>
<p>MekHQ has a lot of features and the developers are often so busy developing it 
that we sadly don't get enough time to play with it. That means that if you catch a 
bug, we may never fix it unless you tell us about it. Reporting bugs is a way that 
everyone can contribute to this project, so please help us out and report bugs when
you find them.</p>

<p>To report a bug, go to the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=269041&atid=1144608">
MekHQ bug tracker page</a> on sourceforge.net. Click on the "Add New" link and enter a description of
the bug. You can also attach two additional items to this report that will greatly assist us in finding
the bug:
<ol>
<li>A copy of the game where the bug occurred, saved in XML format .</li>
<li>A copy of the mekhqlog.txt file located in the logs directory</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Thanks for your help, and good hunting!</p>
