<h1>How to submit a MekHQ bug</h1>
<body>
<p>MekHQ has a lot of features and the developers are often so busy developing it 
that we sadly don't get enough time to play with it. That means that if you catch a 
bug, we may never fix it unless you tell us about it. Reporting bugs is a way that 
everyone can contribute to this project, so please help us out and report bugs when
you find them.</p>

<p>MekHQ uses both MegaMek and MegaMekLab. If you encounter a problem while playing a game, you
should report that to the MegaMek bug tracker, rather than the MekHQ bug tracker. Similarly, if you 
encounter a bug while trying to customize a unit within the MekLab, you should report that bug to the 
MegaMekLab bug tracker. Here are the links for all three bug tackers:</p>

<p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/mekHQ/bugs">MekHQ Bug Tracker</a>
<p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/megamek/bugs">MegaMek Bug Tracker</a>
<p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/megameklab/bugs">MegaMekLab Bug Tracker</a>

<p>To submit a new bug to the bug tracker at sourceforge.net. You can also attach 
two additional items to this report that will greatly assist us in finding
the bug:
<ol>
<li>A copy of the game where the bug occurred, saved in XML format.</li>
<li>A copy of the mekhqlog.txt file located in the logs directory. 
If you are reporting a MegaMek or MegaMekLab bug encountered while running from within MekHQ, 
then you should attach the mekhq log. Otherwise, attach the log for the specific program.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Thanks for your help, and good hunting!</p>
