<a id="stable"></a><h3>What does "stable" mean?</h3></a>
<p>A "stable" release means that we (the developers) are fairly confident that there are no bugs 
that will cause serious problems with the program such as causing the program to crash or preventing
saved games from loading. The stable release does not necessarily mean that all units and all rules are 
fully implemented. In fact, there are several units that are still not fully implemented in this stable
version and these units will not function properly if used. We have a full description of these issues 
below. 

<p>Although, we hope that there are no serious bugs in the stable version, it is possible that we may have
missed some. We will update the stable release version as we come across bugs (both major and minor). If you find
a bug, <a href="http://sf.net/p/mekhq/bugs">please report it</a> and be sure to indicate that you are on the stable release cycle. 


<a id="load"><h3>Can I load my campaign from the 0.1.xx development cycle?</h3></a>

Yes, you can. HOWEVER, various bits of code for reverse compatibility might be removed from
the stable release. To ensure that your campaign loads properly, you should only load a campaign in the stable version
that has been saved with the last release in the 0.1.xx development cycle. At the time of this writing, that
release is version 0.1.24. If you are using an earlier version of MekHQ, you should first download this 
version and then load and save your campaign with it before upgrading to the stable. 

<a id="units"><h3>Which units are fully implemented and which ones are not?</h3></a>

Not all units are fully implemented in this stable version. Please read the descriptions below
before trying to include a particular type of unit.

<h4>Battlemechs</h4>

<p>Battlemechs are fully implemented in this release. All of the parts and repairs should be functioning properly. Customization should also be fully 
functional although some bugs may still be present in the MegaMekLab interface. There are, however, a few caveats:

<h5>Omnimechs</h5>

<p>Omnimechs are fully functional. However, the data files for mechs (MTF files, primarily) do not currently distinguish between pod-based and fixed equipment.
Therefore when customizing units, MHQ will assume that all equipment is pod-mounted and thus it will be possible to "cheat" and remove fixed equipment as if its
a simple omni repodding. We will likely address this issue in the 0.37 development cycle of MM and then integrate it into MHQ and MML. 

<h5>IndustrialMechs</h5>

<p>IndustrialMechs have not been fully tested for the stable release. They simply inherit from the code for Battlemechs, but there may be discrepancies. 
Users should use them at their own risk.

<h4>Vehicles</h4>

<p>Both ground combat vehicles and VTOL craft are fully implemented in this release. All of the parts and repairs should be functioning properly. Customization should also be fully 
functional although some bugs may still be present in the MegaMekLab interface. Currently, vehicle stabilisers and senors are free equipment because while they can be critted, repaired, and 
replaced, they have no recorded cost in the <i>TechManual</i>.

<h5>Support Vehicles and Super-Heavy Vehicles</h5>

<p>Like IndustrialMechs, Support Vehicles and Super-Heavy vehicles simply inherit from the combat vechicle code and have not been fully tested for the stable release. 
Users should use them at their own risk.

<h4>BattleArmor</h4>

<p>BattleArmor is partially functional, but does not follow the rules as it should. First, it does not treat BA armor differently from 
other armor so it will use Standard Mech/Vee armor regardless of what armor type it actually has. Second, it does not track all parts properly 
and so its sale costs are far too low. Third, it does not properly track whether a suit is destroyed in combat or fixable when it is "combat destroyed."
BattleArmor is not currently customizable in the Lab. Implementing BattleArmor in the next dev cycle is a top priority.

<h4>Conventional Infantry</h4>

<p>Conventional infantry is fully implemented in this release and is customizable within MekHQ. However, because the <i>TechManual</i> costs for infantry are not additive via parts 
(and are outrageously high because they apparently include "training" costs for the acutal troopers which creates an apple-and-orange problem with other units), we use a home-brew method of calculating the 
costs of parts associated with conventional infantry leading to different (and far lower) values than canon. We plan on making this method more user-customizable in the next development cycle, but 
currently it is fixed. For more details, see the discussion of costs below.

<h4>Protomechs</h4>

<p>Protomechs are not correctly implemented for this stable release. If you use them and they actually work, consider yourself lucky. Protomech pilots are also not correctly implemented.
They will be implemented in the next dev cycle for sure, because the lead MHQ dev really wants to put together a Society cell made up of Marxist social scientists (don't ask). 

<h4>Aerospace and Conventional Fighters</h4>

<p>Aerospace and conventional fighters should be mostly if not fully implemented in this release. However, re-fueling and tracking bomb supplies is 
not implemented (so probably not a good idea to turn on fuel consumption). There are also quite a few parts on Aeros that are free at the moment because they do not 
have corresponding values in the cost calculations in the <i>TechManual</i>. Also, some of the time requirements for repairing/replacing aero equipment are ridiculously long
because no distinction was made between large and small craft in <i>StratOps</i>.

<h4>Dropships, Jumpships, Warships, and Space Stations</h4>

<p>These units are not properly implemented in this stable release. They can be purchased and used to get the benefit of transportation in the dragoons rating and in the calculation of 
transportation costs, but they should not be used in combat. Also, because many of their parts are still not implemented, the sell value will often be very different from the buy cost.


<a id="values"><h3>Why are the costs of units not correct sometimes?</h3></a>

<p>MekHQ does not use the same formula as MegaMek itself to calculate the value of units. MekHQ bases the value of units on the sum of their actual part objects 
multiplied by the unit factors used in <i>TechManual</i>. The buy costs you see when you purchase a unit are the buy costs from MegaMek (with the exception of conventional infantry), 
while the sale value of units in your hangar is based on MHQ. In a perfect world, this would produce the exact same value as the MegaMek formula but because some parts are unimplemented 
and because some parts with variable costs are still not calculated properly, there is sometimes a discrepancy. For the fully implemented units, 
these differences are generally quite small and will likely not even be noticeable to most users.

<h4>Conventional Infantry costs</h4>

<p>The infantry cost calculation in the <i>TechManual</i> is kind of crazy. There is a square root in there somewhere and everything is multiplied. The upshot of all of this is infantry costs
that are exaggerated relative to the actual cost of equipment that those infantry possess. Historically, this has always been explained as representing the human capital (i.e. training cost) cost
which presumably is why anti-mech infantry are so much more expensive. This unfortunately creates an apples-and-oranges problem in comparing infantry costs to other units which do not
incorporate the training costs of their personnel. For MHQ, its an even bigger problem because we need to be able to clearly separate the costs of equipment from personnel. So, for 
conventional infantry, we use a home-brew system to determine the costs of infantry units (or more correctly, their parts - which we sum up to get the total cost).

This cost is the sum of their weapon costs (no square roots) plus the cost of their motive type and armor. Motive type costs are 
as follows:

<p><table>
<tr><th>Type</th><th>Cost</th></tr>
<tr><td>Foot</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Motorized (per trooper)</td><td>10,732</td></tr>
<tr><td>Jump (per trooper)</td><td>28,621</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hover (per squad)</td><td>196,768</td></tr>
<tr><td>Wheeled (per squad)</td><td>236,122</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tracked (per squad)</td><td>275,475</td></tr>
</table>

<p>These values were determined based on the cost of the Rock Rover Half Track (<i>TRO:VA</i>) which can
be thought of as a fairly generic mechanized squad vehicle. These values were then adjusted for other types
based on the multiplicative factor in the <i>TechManual</i> and maximum squad size. 

<p>Armor costs were creatively determined based on the lowest values for a particular type list in  
<i>TacOps</i>. In the future, we will likely make both motive type and armor cost values more user-customizable, but
for now you are stuck with what we think is best.

<a id="mm"><h3>You call this stable? I am getting tons of bugs with MegaMek and the Lab.</h3></a>

<p>As of this writing, MegaMek is also working on releasing a stable version and MegaMekLab has no stable version in sight. When MM releases a stable, 
we will update the MHQ stable to incorporate it, if possible. We will do the same for MML if it reaches a stable. In the meantime, if you experience a 
bug with these programs you should report them on the appropriate bug tracker. Here are the bug tracker links for each program:
